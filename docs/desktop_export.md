## Get desktop clients exported JSON

There are two ways to export the JSON you need

### TDL (especially for protected chats)

Please refer to [README](../README.md#chat-utilities)

### Official desktop clients

1. Choose the dialog you want to export, and click the three dots in the upper right corner, then
   click `Export Chat History`.

2. Uncheck all boxes(you don't need to download them now) and set `Size Limit` to minimum

3. Set Format to `JSON` and select the time period you need.

4. Export it! And `result.json` is what you need.
